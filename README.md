WorkTodo is a desktop application made with PyQt5.

WorkTodo can keep your data synchronized across multiple devices.
For that you of course first need to create your account.

WorkTodo is using RESTful API to fetch and synchronize your data.
Although unfortunately the source code of that API has to remain private.
