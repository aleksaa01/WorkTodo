### About

WorkTodo is a desktop application made with `PyQt5`, that enables you to schedule your day according to your needs.

WorkTodo can keep your data synchronized across multiple devices.
For that you first need to create your account.

WorkTodo is using custom made `RESTful API` to fetch and synchronize your data.
Unfortunately the source code of that API has to remain private for security purposes and user's safety.
